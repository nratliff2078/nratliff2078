# üéÆ Nick Ratliff's Game Development Portfolio  

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Digital Simulation & Game Programming at Shawnee State University, with minors in Mathematics and Game Design. I started programming my first game at just 13 years old, and I haven't stopped since! I am passionate about creating immersive gaming experiences and have developed several projects across various platforms and engines.
