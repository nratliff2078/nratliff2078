# 🎮 Nick Ratliff's Game Development Portfolio  
I am a game developer with a strong foundation in programming, mathematics, and game design principles. I have developed several small game engines using C++ and have a strong fundamental understanding of systems programming and architectural designs. I also have experience working with multiple game engines and tools, including Unreal Engine, Godot, and BYOND's DreamMaker. I love exploring innovative gameplay mechanics and the behind-the-scenes systems programming.
